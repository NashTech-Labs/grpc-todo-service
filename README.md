# grpc-todo-service
An efficient gRPC-based TODO service for managing tasks with features to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks, along with listing all tasks. Built with Kotlin and Protocol Buffers.

gRPC, or Google Remote Procedure Call, is a framework used for efficient and language-agnostic communication between distributed systems. It employs Protocol Buffers for data serialization, resulting in compact and efficient data exchange. gRPC is favored for its ability to reduce latency, support multiplexing, and provide strongly typed service contracts, making it a compelling choice for building high-performance and interoperable microservices, APIs, and distributed applications.

Using Kotlin with gRPC offers numerous advantages, including concise and expressive code, seamless interoperability with Java, modern language features like null safety and coroutines for asynchronous programming, and strong tooling support. Additionally, Kotlin's official support for Android development makes it an ideal choice for building gRPC-based services that can be easily integrated into Android applications, simplifying development and ensuring code consistency across platforms.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Kotlin
- Protocol Buffers (protobuf) compiler
- Maven

## Getting Started
Run the main class from intellij

or
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
### Check build reports-
Run the command
```
mvn clean install
```

Watch the below video to see how you can test your gRPC service on bloomRPC.
